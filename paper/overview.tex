This paper is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}

\item Section \ref{sec:example} introduces the example which exhibits both limitations for which CFLR does not yet solve for.
\item Section \ref{sec:ecflr} proposes an extension to CFLR to solve both limitations.
\item Section \ref{sec:automata} studies what this extension means for analyses using CFLR through the lens of automata theory.
\item Section \ref{sec:related} discusses related works.
\item Section \ref{sec:conclusion} summarizes the arguments laid out in this work.

\end{itemize}
