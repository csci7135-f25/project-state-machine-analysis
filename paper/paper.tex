%% article.
\begin{abstract}
	Since Thomas Reps' paper, Program Analysis via Graph Reachability, 
	much work has been devoted to optimizing the reachability solver, and refining the graph construction process.
	However, there has been no study yet, to our knowledge, of the types of analysis for which Context-Free Language Reachability (CFLR) cannot be deployed in
	the traditional techniques of a Dyck-Language and the Pushdown Automata Reachability Solver.
	%This work seeks to establish the limitations of CFLR for program analysis by drawing a relationship between the languages employed for each question, 
	%thus the state-machine required to compute the reachability answer, and the analysis question of interest.
	For example, dominance of one basic block on the next is not an analysis for which Dyck-Reachability has been employed for, nor has there been work for why that is.
	This work argues that Dominance, and other analyses that require reasoning over multiple paths, represent a class of questions that cannot be solved with CFLR.
	Furthermore, the Automata required to solve the problem can bring insight into the analysis of interest including a best approach to optimizing an algorithm.
