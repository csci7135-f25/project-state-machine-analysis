Over the course of this work, it has been described how traditional Context-Free Language Reachability is limited in the types of analyses it can solve.
The work covers how Dominators for Control-Flow Analysis cannot be described by a Dyck-Language without pre-computing the answer before the reachability solver,
and how changing the input graph for Dominators would be sidestepping the limitations by simply not using Context-Free Language Reachability.
Following the limitations, we define a new class of Context-Free Language Reachability, namely the All-Paths type, and use this new class to propose
a Strict Dominance Algorithm using the CFLR framework.
The Strict Dominance Algorithm is then analyzed using automata theory to reason about 
why the runtime complexity might be lower than the Cubic Bottleneck commonly associated with other analyses.
